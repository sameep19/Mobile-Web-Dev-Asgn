                  <h2>Mathematics</h2>
                  <p>
                     Mathematics is the science and study of quality, structure, space, and change. Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth
                     by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.

                  <h2>Algebra</h2>
                  <p>
                     Algebra is a branch of mathematics in which arithmetic operations and other formal manipulations are applied to abstract symbols rather than specific numbers. 
                     Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the shape of objects, their spatial relations, and the properties of the space the objects are in. 
                  </p>

                  <h2 class="user-select-none">Trignometry</h2>
                  <p class="user-select-none">
                     Trigonometry, the branch of mathematics concerned with specific functions of angles and their application to calculations. There are six functions of an angle 
                     commonly used in trigonometry. Their names and abbreviations are sine (sin), cosine (cos), tangent (tan), cotangent (cot), secant (sec), and cosecant (csc).

                  <h3>Calculus</h3>
                  <p>
                    Calculus is the mathematical study of change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of operations and their application to 
                    solving equations.

                  <h3>Statistics</h3>
                  <p>
                    Statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data, or as a branch of
                    mathematics. Some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics.

                    <h2>Matrices</h2>
                    <p>
                    Matrix, a set of numbers arranged in rows and columns so as to form a rectangular array. The numbers are called the elements, or entries, of the matrix.
                    Matrices have wide applications in engineering, physics, economics, and statistics as well as in various branches of mathematics

                    <h2>Logic</h2>
                    <p>
                        Logic is the study of Truth and how we can obtain universal Truths trough mathematical deduction. It is the most basic language of mathematics, and the 
                        underlying principle of proof. Mathematical logic and reasoning dates back many thousand years, to ancient Egyptian architects and Babylonian astronomers.
